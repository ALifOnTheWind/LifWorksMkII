          Lif is a budding programmer from a dimension that exists somewhere between Camelot, and that irritating space next to you car seat that swallows your phone all the time.  His mission, passion, and occasional aggrevation is to use his keen eye and eccentric mental lens, to bring you solutions to problems that others may not necessarily have found.

          In his spare time, Lif enjoys debating the ethical implications of ping-pong with goblins, harvesting sound from the air waves for recycling, and telling people the biological proess of making beer while they drink said beer.
